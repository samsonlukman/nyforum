                <p class="mb-4">
                    Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of

                    the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
                    agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we
